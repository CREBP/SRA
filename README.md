Systematic Review Assistant
===========================
The Systematic Review Assistant (SRA) project is based at the [Bond University Center for Research in Evidence-Based Practice](http://crebp.net.au) was originally conceived under the aim of drastically reducing the amount of time it takes to construct a Systematic Review using Information Technology.

The assistance it gives researches when constructing reviews is split into a number of different modules:

* Search Strategy Optimization - Providing various 'hooks' into the main citation search engines, the SRA project allows for easy consolidation and collection of references which may be used in the systematic review.
* Reference Deduplication - As most searches use multiple search engines and sources it is necessary to locate, merge and/or eliminate duplicate references before continuing onto the next stages.
* Initial screening - Providing a simple 'skim reading' interface to quickly categorize all references found in the previous stages as valuable, for reference only or eliminate from future study.
* Finding full text references - In partnership with other research projects it is an eventual aim of the SRA project to automatically locate and obtain full-text papers for all references from the previous stages.
* Screening full text - An extension of the initial screening stage, this allows for the closer screening of articles based on their full-text content.
* Multiple researcher consolidation - Providing the ability for multiple researchers to assess references from any of the previous screening stages.


Goals
=====
* Integrated citation management tools including various functionality useful to Systematic Review creation
* Federalized search engine aimed specifically at Systematic Reviews
* Multiple-user abstract / full-text screening process
* Automated Abstract and Method section creation tools
* Tools useful to Systematic Reviews - Forest Plots and various other outputs
